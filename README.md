# Assignment 4 — Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python

This repository contains two Python scripts as part of Module 5.

## Task 1 — Read a File and Handle Errors
- Opens a file named `sample.txt` and prints its contents line by line.
- Handles `FileNotFoundError` gracefully if the file does not exist.

**File:** `task1_read_file.py`

## Task 2 — Write and Append Data to a File
- Takes user input and writes it to `output.txt`.
- Appends additional data.
- Reads and displays the final content of the file.

**File:** `task2_write_append.py`

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run each file using:
   ```bash
   python task1_read_file.py
   python task2_write_append.py
